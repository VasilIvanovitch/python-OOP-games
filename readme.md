Python OOP Games
This repository contains two games developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course on Stepik https://stepik.org/course/116336/syllabus. The games are implemented in Python.

Tic-Tac-Toe
The first game is Tic-Tac-Toe, a classic two-player game where players take turns marking X or O in a 3x3 grid. The objective is to get three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

Battleship
The second game is Battleship, a strategic guessing game played on a grid representing the ocean. Players place their ships on the grid and take turns guessing the coordinates to "sink" their opponent's ships. In addition to the standard rules, this version of the game allows players to choose the size of the game board from 8x8 to 12x12 cells. There is also an option where ships can move one cell in the direction of their orientation after each opponent's turn if there were no hits.

How to Run the Games
To run the games locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or above).
Install the required dependencies by running the command pip install -r requirements.txt.
Navigate to the respective game directory (tic_tac_toe or battleship) in your terminal or command prompt.
Run the game by executing the corresponding Python file. For example, for Tic-Tac-Toe, run python tic_tac_toe.py.
